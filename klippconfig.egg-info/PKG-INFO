## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This project is a work in progress. Expect broken features, incomplete workflows, and frequent changes while development is ongoing.

KlippConfig is a Windows-first desktop app that helps you create, validate, and deploy Klipper configuration files.

## Start Here (If You Are New to Klipper)

KlippConfig is built to reduce manual editing and help you avoid common config mistakes.

What it helps with:

- Guided setup for a new printer config (preset + board + options)
- Validation before upload
- Safe upload workflows over SSH
- Editing and validating existing `.cfg` files
- Backups and restore workflows for live printers

Current limitation:

- Add-ons are temporarily disabled in the app while that workflow is being reworked.

## Dependencies (Unpackaged Run)

Install these before running the app from source:

- Python 3.11+
- `PySide6>=6.8.0`
- `pydantic>=2.10.0`
- `jsonschema>=4.23.0`
- `Jinja2>=3.1.4`
- `paramiko>=3.5.0`

## Quick Start (From Source)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e .[dev]
pythonw -m app.main
```

## First-Time Workflow (New Firmware)

1. Open the app and go to `Main`.
2. Click `New Firmware`.
3. In `Configuration`, select your preset and board.
4. Click `Compile`.
5. Open `Files` and review generated files and validation status.
6. Open `Printer -> Connection Window...`, then connect to your printer.
7. Use `Upload Current` when validation looks good.

## If You Already Have a Klipper Config

1. Use `Modify Existing` for guided remote edit/upload/restart flow.
2. Use `Files` for local `.cfg` open, refactor, and validation.
3. Use `Manage Printer` for direct remote file browsing, backup, and restore.
